# CSE564: Reinforcement Learning

## About CSE564

**[CSE564: *Reinforcement Learning*](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE564)** is a 5xx-level course offered to undergrads pursuing the CS and ECE disciplines at IIIT-Delhi. The course introduces students to the basics of reinforcement learning techniques with mathematical rigour. It aims to enable students to:

- implement and analyze [Value and Policy Iteration Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process#Notable_variants)
- describe algorithms for [Model-free Reinforcement Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-free_(reinforcement_learning))
- use and build projects using commonly available RL Libraries
